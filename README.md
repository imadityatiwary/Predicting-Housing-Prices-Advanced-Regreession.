# Predicting-Housing-Prices-Advanced-Regreession.
This is a project that has been made by me in 2nd year of my college and it predicts house prices.I have used various models like:Lasso and Ridge regression and XGboost and LightGBM also which upon averaging provide a good model which works with a great accuracy.
